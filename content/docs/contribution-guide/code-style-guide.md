## High-Quality Code: A Shared Understanding

Spending additional time to write high-quality, readable code is crucial for success in software engineering. Clear and easily comprehensible code not only saves time during development but also simplifies onboarding and collaboration.

In case you are interested, we recommend the following reads for improving your code quality.

## Why Follow a Code Style Guide?

A shared code style ensures:
- Uniform and high-quality code that is easier to understand and maintain.
- Simplified onboarding for new team members.
- Fewer errors caused by inconsistencies.

To align with industry standards and avoid reinventing the wheel, we adhere to **PEP 8** ([Python Enhancement Proposal 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)).

## Linting & Formatting
We use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for Python linting and formatting.

Install ruff via `pip install ruff`.

Use `ruff format` and `ruff check --fix` to keep your code compliant.
