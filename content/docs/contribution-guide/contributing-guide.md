## Contribution Guidelines

<!-- If you are eager to start contributing code right away, we have a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra/labels/good%20first%20issue) that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. Alternatively, you can ceck for issues labeled as [“help wanted”](https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra/labels/help%20wanted) for beginner-friendly feature extensions. As you gain more experience and demonstrate a commitment to evolving Oakestra, you may be granted issue management permissions in the repository. -->
