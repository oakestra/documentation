## How does the scheduling work in Oakestra?


Oakestra's architecture is composed of two tiers. Resources are divided into clusters. A cluster is seen as the aggregation of all its resources. A job is first scheduled to a cluster, and then the cluster scheduler decides the target worker.

The scheduling component is as simple as a Celery worker. The scheduler receives a job description and gives back an allocation target. We differentiate between the Root scheduler and Cluster scheduler. The Root scheduler finds a suitable cluster (step 1), and the Cluster scheduler finds a suitable worker node (step 2).

This scheduling algorithm does not ensure an absolute optimal deployment but consistently reduces the search space. 

## Scheduling Algorithm

At each layer, the scheduling decision consists of the creation of a `candidate_list` of clusters (or workers), the exclusion of unsuitable candidates, and then the selection of the "best" candidate accordingly to a scheduling algorithm.

The scheduling algorithms are implemented in the `calculation.py` component of each respective scheduler. 

The current released version only implements a **best fit** and **first fit** calculation strategies. However, on its way to the release, we have our new LDP algorithm (check it out on our [whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01577.pdf)).

## Job Constraints

The Job deployment descriptor allows a developer to specify constraints of 4 types: node **resources**, **network** capabilities, **geographical** positioning, and **direct** mapping. 

### Resources

The job resource requirements cause the immediate exclusion of a candidate from the candidate list. These resources represent the bare minimum required by the job to operate properly. Here there is a table of the supported resources and the state of development:

|Resource type|Status|Comments|
|---|---|---|
|Virtualization|🟢|Fully functional containers support. Unikernel support is under development. |
|CPU|🟢|Only number of CPU cores   
|Memory|🟢|Memory requirements in MB
|Storage|🟠|It is possible to specify it, but it is not **yet** taken into account by the scheduler 
|GPU|🟠|Possibility of specifying the GPU cores. But not yet the available GPU drivers. Right now, the support is only for CUDA.
|TPU|🔴|Not yet under development
|Architecture|🔴|Not yet possible to filter out the architecture. With containers, it is possible to use the multi-platform build. This flag is coming out together with the Unikernel support. 

### Network & Geo constraints

The networking requirements selection and geographic constraints support are coming out in our next release **v0.5** and are part of the LDP algorithm update. Stay tuned. 

### Direct mapping positioning

It is possible to specify a **direct mapping** constraint. Therefore, in the deployment description, a developer can specify a list of target clusters and nodes. The scheduling algorithm operates only on the active clusters (or nodes) among the given list. 

This direct mapping approach is currently based on `cluster names` and `worker hostnames`. We are anyway considering adding a label-based positioning where it is possible to tag resources with custom-defined labels. Stay tuned for more.
