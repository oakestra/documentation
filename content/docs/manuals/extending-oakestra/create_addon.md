<span class="lead">
To install an addon, it first has to be published to the marketplace. Addons are published as a Dockerfile
containing the addon functionality and a configuration file outlining the addons specifications.
</span>

{{< callout context="tip" title="Global Marketplace" icon="outline/rocket" >}}

Currently there isn't a global marketplace for addons. Keep an eye our for this in future releases!

### Dockerize the Addon
Package your code into a Docker image by creating a `Dockerfile` such as:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-alpine

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . /addon

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/addon/main.py"]
```

Build and push the Docker image to a container registry, such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/):
```bash
docker build -t your-username/addon-name:latest .
docker push your-username/addon-name:latest
```

### Publish the Addon to the Marketplace
Define the addon configuration according to the following template:
```json
{
  "name": "addon-name",
  "networks": [],
  "volumes": [{
    "name": "myvolume",
    "driver": "bridge"
  }],
  "services": [{
    "image": "your-username/addon-name:latest",
    "service_name": "my_service",
    "networks": [],
    "volumes": ["myvolume:/somevolume"],
    "ports": {"10007":"10007"}
  }]
}
```
Where:
- **name**: Identifies the addon
- **services**: Defines the service(s) required by the addon.
- **volumes/networks**: Specifies optional configurations for data persistence or connectivity.


To make the addon available for others in the Oakestra ecosystem, publish it to the addons marketplace by sending a `POST` request with the JSON descriptor to the addons marketplace API `/api/v1/marketplace/addons`.

The addons marketplace will validate the descriptor. Once approved, the addon will be marked as `approved` and become available for installation.


{{< callout context="note" title="Plugins" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
To create a service that would replace a component inside Oakestra (i.e. a [Plugin](../../../concepts/oakestra-extensions/addons)), the service name should match the name of that component. 

For instance, to replace the scheduler component the service would have to be called by its exact name `cloud_scheduler`.
Note the difference between a service and an addon, is that an **addon may contain multiple services**.
