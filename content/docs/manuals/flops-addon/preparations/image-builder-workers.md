  FLOps relies on dynamically built container images.
  FLOps delegates and distributes this task to orchestrated worker nodes to minimize bottlenecks and optimize computational efficiency.
  Only nodes that have been prepared as described on this page are capable of building images for FLOps.

  For FLOps to work as intended, you are required to prepare at least one of your orchestrated nodes, as described in this guide.

{{< callout context="tip" title="Optimize Image Build Times" icon="outline/rocket" >}}
  Building images is a significant part of any FLOps project, including its runtime.
  Select your worker nodes wisely for building images.
  To speed up runtimes, prefer more powerful resource-rich machines.

On the worker nodes where you wish to do the image building, do the following:
- Ensure the NodeEngine is running
  ```bash
    sudo NodeEngine -a <cluster-address> -d && sudo NodeEngine status
  ```
- Activate the `imageBuilder` addon for the NodeEngine:
  ```bash
    sudo NodeEngine config addon imageBuilder on
  ```
- Restart the NodeEngine
  - Either run `sudo NodeEngine stop` and then start it up again
  - Or run `sudo systemctl restart nodeengine.service` 
- Verify that the addon is active:
  ```bash
    > sudo NodeEngine config addon

    Configured Addons:
         - image-builder: ðŸŸ¢ Active
  ```
