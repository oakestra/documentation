## Deploy Multiple Clusters

Having one root orchestrator and one cluster orchestrator on one device is a great way to start using Oakestra, but the true power
of the system lies in it's federated architecture.

This guide will walk you through deploying stand-alone components, allowing you to
deploy multiple cluster orchestrators across multiple devices. These clusters will be managed by a single root orchestrator.

### Stand-alone Root Orchestrator

{{<svg "architecture/Arch-Root">}}

First, let's deploy a stand-alone root orchestrator. This component will manage your clusters and provide an interface for users to interact with the Oakestra setup 
by providing an [API](../../getting-started/deploy-app/with-the-api/) and a [dashboard](../../getting-started/deploy-app/with-the-dashboard/).

```bash
curl -sfL oakestra.io/install-root.sh | sh - 
```

This script will download the required files to the directory `~/oakestra/root_orchestrator`. From there it will build the root orchestrator.

If you run into a restricted network (e.g., on a cloud VM) you need to configure the firewall rules and the NetManager component accordingly. Please refer to: [Firewall Setup](../firewall-configuration)

### Stand-alone Cluster Orchestrator

{{<svg "architecture/Arch-Cluster">}}

Next, we can deploy a stand-alone cluster orchestrator. This component will manage the nodes by delegating applications, creating subnetworks and
facilitating communication. Additionally the cluster orchestrator sends aggregated reports to the root orchestrator.

```bash
curl -sfL oakestra.io/install-cluster.sh | sh - 
```

This script will download the required files to the directory `~/oakestra/cluster_orchestrator`. From there it will walk you through
configuring the cluster. Once the setup is complete, it will build the cluster orchestrator and register with the root orchestrator.

You can register as many cluster orchestrators with the root orchestrator as you would like. Repeat the above commmand on a new device and [configure](#configure-the-orchestrators) the orchestrator with a unique `Cluster Name` and `Cluster Location`.

## Custom Deployments

Oakestra also allows you to customize your system deployment to best suit your needs.

### Configure the Orchestrators

The root and cluster orchestrator can be configured using environment variables. If they have not been set, they are automatically set when using the above scripts. They can also be manually configured, e.g. when building using the docker compose files.


**Root Orchestrator Environment Variables**
* `SYSTEM_MANAGER_URL`: Specify how the root orchestrator can be reached (URL or IP)

```bash
# Example configuration for root orchestrator
export SYSTEM_MANAGER_URL=192.158.18.104
```

**Cluster Orchestrator Environment Variables**

* `SYSTEM_MANAGER_URL`: Specify how the root orchestrator can be reached (URL or IP)
* `CLUSTER_NAME`: Specify the name of the cluster. Make sure this is unique for every additional cluster
* `CLUSTER_LOCATION`: (optional) Specify the location of the cluster in the format `<latitude>, <longitude>, <radius>`

```bash
# Example configuration for cluster orchestrator
export SYSTEM_MANAGER_URL=192.158.18.104
export CLUSTER_NAME=My_Cluster
export CLUSTER_LOCATION=48.26275365157924,11.668627302307236,100
```

{{< callout context="danger" title="Watch out!" icon="outline/alert-octagon" >}}
The root orchestrator has to be reachable by the cluster orchestrator. When not on the same network the root orchestrator URL has to be a public
address!

### Choose a Different Branch

By default these scripts will compose the services of the `main` oakestra branch, the latest stable release. However this can be changed by setting the environment variable `OAKESTRA_BRANCH` <u>before running the startup script</u>.
This allows you to experiment with some unreleased features.

```bash
export OAKESTRA_BRANCH=develop
```
This will allow you to use the services from the alpha Oakestra release.

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Oakestra has many features which have not yet been released. You can check out what's in the pipeline by taking a look at some of the active [branches](https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra/branches) here.

### Compose Overrides

Since Oakestra uses docker-compose to build the components, we can use overrides to fine-tune our build environment.

To use the override files, specify the them in a comma-seperated list by setting the `OVERRIDE_FILES` env variable <u>before running the startup script</u>.
```bash
export OVERRIDE_FILES=override-alpha-versions.yaml
```
