  Oakestra supports addons via its addon marketplace.

  The FLOps addon enables practical application-oriented federated machine learning.
  It automates ML/FL duties for the user by building on top of DevOps and MLOps concepts, including:
  - Handling the setup and configuration of the ML environment by building multi-platform container images.
  - Scheduling and handling FL learners and aggregators - performing the FL training.
  - State-of-the-art observability capabilities via a modern browser-based GUI.
  - Providing the trained model for pulling and automatic deployment as an inference server.
  - Allow users to customize their FL by specifying various aspects ranging from training rounds to their FL strategy.

  Note that FLOps is not yet available in the marketplace.

  The `oak-cli` acts as an interface to the FLOps addon.
