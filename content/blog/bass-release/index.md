## Modernized Documentation

![dashboard-screenshot](dashboard.png)

Our completely overhauled documentation website is more than just a new look‚Äîit's a reimagined resource designed to guide you effortlessly through every aspect of Oakestra. Built on modern frameworks, the site adapts seamlessly to desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Whether you‚Äôre troubleshooting an issue or learning new features, you always have a smooth and intuitive experience. Every article has been refined for clarity and depth, making it the definitive guide for both beginners and seasoned developers.

## Developer-Friendly Command Line Interface

Oakestra now includes its own [public CLI tool](https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra-cli) called `oak-cli`. It is a significant game-changer that makes life easier for Oakestra users and developers. The `oak-cli` includes powerful dynamic and customizable features to automate every aspect of your Oakestra workflows, including installing dependencies, deploying applications and services, inspecting service logs in real time, and much more.

![oak-cli-gif](cli.gif)

The `oak-cli` is just getting started. We envision that the `oak-cli` will become the primary interface for working with Oakestra soon, so we encourage you to start using it straight away.

To download it, simply run

```bash
pip install oak-cli
```

{{< callout context="tip" title="Get started with oak-cli" icon="outline/terminal" >}}
Learn how to use the `oak-cli` to create your first Oakestra application [here](https://www.oakestra.io/docs/getting-started/deploy-app/with-the-cli/) and explore every available command [here](https://www.oakestra.io/docs/manuals/cli/cli-overview/).

## Federated Learning Support

Embracing the future of machine learning, our new FLOps addon introduces robust federated learning capabilities into Oakestra. Wondering *"What is Federated Learning?"* ‚Äîcheck out our [brief explanation](https://www.oakestra.io/docs/concepts/flops/fl-basics/).

{{<svg "flops_overview">}}

This addon automatically augments your standard machine learning code into FL-compatible, multi-platform container images and deploys them onto orchestrated worker nodes for training. Users can monitor training rounds live via a sophisticated GUI, then pull the trained model or let FLOps build and deploy an inference server. FLOps supports both classical and clustered hierarchical federated learning, leveraging tools like [Flower](https://flower.ai/), [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/), and [Buildah](https://buildah.io/).

## Oakestra Addons

Addons in the Bass release let developers extend or customize Oakestra's components. With this release, you can install plugins or extensions in your Root Orchestrator. A **Plugin** replaces an Oakestra component with a custom one (e.g., replacing the root scheduler), while an **Extension** deploys a new custom component alongside the existing control plane.

{{< callout context="tip" icon="outline/packages" >}}
Extend Oakestra functionality by defining your own addons. Learn more in our [detailed guide](https://www.oakestra.io/docs/concepts/oakestra-extensions/addons/).
{{< /callout >}}

## Lifecycle Hooks

With the Bass release, Oakestra introduces lifecycle hooks. Hooks allow developers to register, listen to, and react on lifecycle events of your applications. We now support *Creation*, *Update*, and *Deletion* hooks. Synchronous hooks block operations until a response is received, while asynchronous hooks notify subscribers without delay.

{{<svg "hooks">}}

For example, you can register an asynchronous `post_update` hook to trigger alerts when an application‚Äôs state changes, or a synchronous `pre_update` hook to update the service status with your custom logic.

{{< callout context="note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
For more details, visit our [wiki](https://www.oakestra.io/docs/concepts/oakestra-extensions/hooks/).
{{< /callout >}}

## Priviledged Containers

For advanced use cases requiring elevated system access, the new privileged containers feature is a game changer. By setting the `"privileged": true` flag in your SLA microservice description, you can deploy containers with full system privileges‚Äîideal for scenarios demanding direct hardware access or specialized kernel operations. This feature remains securely disabled by default and is enabled only when explicitly needed.

{{< callout context="caution" title="Important" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
Privileged containers unlock enhanced functionality but must be used with care due to their elevated permissions.

## Fixes and Improvements

- Upgraded MongoDB version
- Improved startup and installation scripts
- Fixed cluster direct mapping constraints issues
- Added systemd compatibility for NodeEngine and NetManager
- Introduced Mosquitto broker authentication options

### Celebrate Christmas in Style with Oakestra-Powered Edge Gaming

On Christmas üéÑ, we inaugurated the Bass release with an Edge Gaming deployment of Minecraft. We deployed the Minecraft web client, proxy, and server on Oakestra and enjoyed a multiplayer session right in our browsers!
